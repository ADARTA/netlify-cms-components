## Custom Backend for NetlifyCMS

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/ADARTA/netlify-cms-components/master.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/ADARTA/netlify-cms-components)
[![](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/netlify-cms-backend-fs.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/netlify-cms-backend-fs)

***Notes:*** 

- This library is still in beta!
- Version 0.4.0 is a breaking change üêâ.
- Version 0.4.0+ is only compatible with builds of `netlify-cms-app` (2.9.0+).
- This is a backend library for NetlifyCMS proposed for file system testing locally during development.
- Handy for testing your config files.

To use:

To load dependencies for build

```bash
yarn add netlify-cms-backend-fs --dev
```

or

```bash
npm install netlify-cms-backend-fs --save-dev
```
## Parts of this package

Backend library bundles exist in `dist` directory.

- `dist/index.js` can be used for global access to `FileSystemBackendClass` and is a `umd` build to use directly as a component see example in `netlify-cms-starter` in this monorepo.

Express server middleware is in the `dist/fs` directory.

- `dist/fs/index.js` (not bundled) has the node script to be used as middleware for webpack devServer or express server to create the api for development.

## How to register with CMS on a static page locally (testing only, not recommended)

  - Change the `index.html` page to use the backend as in the example below
  - Register the backend Class to the CMS as shown below
  - Change the `config.yml` backend to `backend: file-system` or the name you registered
  - [Webpack] Add devServer middleware to expose the `/api` path for the file-system API
  - [Stand Alone Server] Create an express server (example coming soon) to host the `/api` endpoint

### Add script and register in your CMS page

**_NOTE:_** v4.x of this library will not work without a current version of `netlify-cms-app` (see notes at the top of this document).

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>NetlifyCMS</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Include the script that builds the page and powers Netlify CMS -->
      <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@^16/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
      <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@^16/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>
      <script src="https://unpkg.com/netlify-cms-default-exports@2.2.1/dist/netlify-cms-default-exports.js"></script>
      <script src="https://unpkg.com/netlify-cms-app@2.9.0/dist/netlify-cms-app.js"></script>
      <script src="https://unpkg.com/netlify-cms-backend-fs@0.4.4/dist/index.js"></script>
    <script>
      var CMS = NetlifyCmsApp;
      CMS.registerBackend("file-system", FileSystemBackendClass)
      CMS.init(); // Manually starts the CMS on the page after the registration of the backend
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
### Start your devServer using the middleware scripts

`server.js`
```javascript
const express = require('express')
const fsMiddleware = require('netlify-cms-backend-fs/dist/fs')
const app = express()
const port = 3000
const host = 'localhost'

app.use(express.static('.')) // root of our site

// add cors code here (shown below) if you have a cors issue

fsMiddleware(app) // sets up the /api proxy paths

app.listen(port, () => console.log(
    `
    Server listening at http://${host}:${port}/
    API listening at http://${host}:${port}/api
    `
))
```
### Cors issue

If having a cors problem when running on different ports, you can add the following to the express app.

```
var allowCrossDomain = function(req, res, next) {
    res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
    res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET,PUT,POST,DELETE');
    res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type');
    next();
}
app.use(allowCrossDomain);
```

## Some examples of `netlify-cms-backend-fs` in projects

- see the [netlify-cms-starter][1] for a create-react-app example in this monorepo.
- see [ADARTA/netlify-cms-react-example][4] for a full create-react-app example.
- see [ADARTA/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms][5] for a Gatsby use case example (WIP).


## Dependencies

This library requires you to be using [NetlifyCMS][3] v2.9.x or above (see notes at the top).

***Recommendation:*** If you are looking to extend NetlifyCMS and run a local file-system setup for development, use the [netlify-cms-react-example][4] starter project. It implements the backend as a component and bundles to a custom CMS deployment for your project.

***WARNING:*** This is a development tool. It can safely be used in a repository locally, since it is not used in production code. Commit and push changes before you start using.

Don't forget: code like you're on üî•
